Name:       F2HSSTAT
Position:   2028
Length:     2
Label:      High school completion status in 2006

Description:
First follow-up, transcript, and second follow-up data are all used as
inputs for F2HSSTAT. First follow-up data is used in cases where the
respondent indicated during the first follow-up they had already
received a high school credential; transcript data (as preloaded for
the F2 instrument) is used in cases where the respondent?s transcript
indicated they received a May or June 2004 diploma or certificate of
attendance (see also F2PHSDG and F2PHSDT). For second follow-up
respondents for whom neither of these conditions apply, F2HSSTAT is
determined by the following variables: type of high school credential
received (F2A02); high school credential date (F2A03); or, for
respondents who had not yet received a high school credential, whether
they are currently pursuing any such credential (F2A07). For second
follow-up nonrespondents, F2HSSTAT is determined by transcript or
first follow-up data (if they indicate a final high school completion
status).
Note:  There are a small set of cases where F2HSSTAT is set to 1, 2,
or 3 as a result of a re-examination of transcript information during
F2 data editing activities. This small set of cases is made up of F2
nonrespondents who did not indicate receipt of a high school
credential during F1 participation (or were F1 nonrespondents), and
where F1RTROUT = 8 (dropped out) or 9 (transferred).

Length:     2
Label:      F2 ever dropped out

Description:
Indicates whether the sample member has dropped out at some point in
time. Cases identified by F1EVERDO as ?ever dropouts? remain as such
in F2EVERDO; these cases include student-reported dropouts (as
reported via F1 participation; note, however, that F1 student,
transfer, and homeschool questionnaire respondents were not asked
whether they had had a dropout episode), and school-reported dropouts
(as reported at any of the 3 enrollment status updates). F1EVERDO is
then updated with second follow-up and transcript information as
follows:  first follow-up nonrespondents who reported in the second
follow-up that they were not in school during the spring term of 2004
(F2A12=5) or that they were out for 4 or more weeks during that term
(F2A13=1) are classified as 'ever dropouts'. Also classified as
'ever dropouts' are second follow-up respondents who reported that
they had completed a GED since they were last interviewed (F2A02=3),
or they had not received a high school credential and were not in a
high school completion program (F2A07=3 or 4). Finally, cases where
the sample member's transcript indicates that the sample member
dropped out, received a GED, was dismissed, or incarcerated
(F1RTROUT=8, 12, 14,or 15, respectively) are coded as ?ever dropouts?
in F2EVERDO.

Label:      Student ID

Description:
Student ID is composed of the 4-digit School ID (which consists of
the 3-digit stratum and 1-digit PSU) and a 2-digit sequential
student code within school.
Stratum (STRAT_ID) and PSU are embedded in STU_ID for ease of use
in certain variance estimation programs.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard-copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated-version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Name:       BYRACE
Position:   75
Length:     2
Label:      Student's race/ethnicity-composite

Description:
BYRACE was previously named RACE on the BY ECB.
The race/Hispanic ethnicity variable is obtained from the student
questionnaire, when available; sampling roster, if missing on the
questionnaire; or parent questionnaire, if missing on the sampling
roster and parent respondent is biological parent. Race/ethnicity was
logically imputed from other questionnaire items (e.g., surname,
native language) if missing from all available sources. Race adheres
to the following definitions:
American Indian or Alaska Native, not Hispanic or Latino
(This category includes only persons who reported American Indian or
Alaska Native as their sole race and did not report Hispanic
ethnicity)
Asian, Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, not Hispanic or Latino
(This category includes persons who reported Asian as their sole race,
but did not report Hispanic ethnicity. Additionally, Hawaiians and
Pacific Islanders are included in this category even though they were
collected separately, due to small reported numbers and to preserve
consistency with related longitudinal studies. The restricted-use
data file contains a variable which maintains a separate category for
Hawaiians/other Pacific Islanders.)
Black, not Hispanic or Latino
(This category includes only persons who reported Black as their sole
race, but did not report Hispanic ethnicity)
Hispanic, no race specified
(This category includes Hispanic or Latino ethnicity only. Race
information was not reported for these cases; only Hispanic
indication.)
Hispanic or Latino, regardless of race
(This category includes Hispanic or Latino ethnicity and any
combination of race)
More than one race, non-Hispanic
(This category includes only persons who reported two or more races
but did not report Hispanic ethnicity)
White, not Hispanic or Latino
(This category includes only persons who reported White as their sole
race but did not report Hispanic ethnicity)
The restricted file presents race as a series of five dichotomous
variables (the respondent is/is not White; is/is not Black, etc.).
The variables are: White, Black, American Indian/AN, Asian, Native
Hawaiian/PI. For disclosure risk reasons, simplified versions of race
appear on the public files, with NH/PI combined with Asian.

Position:   167
Length:     2
Label:      Number of academic risk factors in 10th grade

Description:
This variable indicates the number of academic risk factors associated
with each sample member. Academic risk factors include whether the
sample member:  (1) comes from a single-parent household; (2) has two
parents without a high school diploma; (3) has a sibling who has
dropped out of school; (4) has changed schools two or more times
(excluding changes due to school promotions); (5) has repeated at
least one grade; and (6) comes from a household with an income below
the federal threshold for poverty. Households are considered
impoverished if family income is $20,000 or less and household size is
5 or less; $25,000 or less if household size is 6 or 7; $35,000 or
less if household size is 8; and $50,000 or less if household size is
9 or more.
Note: Three of the six risk factors counted in this variable are
based on imputed variables, which therefore contain no missing values
(F1FCOMP, F1PARED, and BYINCOME). The remaining three risk factors
are based on Parent Questionnaire variables; BYRISKFC values of -4
(nonrespondent) and -8 (survey component legitimate skip) therefore
refer to missing data from the Parent Questionnaire.

Label:      BY hours per week spent on homework (in and out of school)

Description:
Indicates the number of hours per week the respondent spends
working on homework both in-school and out-of-school, as of the base
year.
Note: Time spent on homework in-school and time spent on homework out-
of-school were asked as separate questions in the base year
questionnaire; these two variables were top-coded at 21 and 26 hours,
respectively. BYHMWRK values of 97, 98, and 99 indicate that at least
one of these input values was top-coded for the respondent, and
therefore a more precise value cannot be calculated.
SAS code:
If BYS34A in (-4,-8) then BYHMWRK=BYS34A;
Else if BYS34A=21 and BYS34B=26 then BYHMWRK=99;
Else if BYS34A=21 then BYHMWRK=98;

Else BYHMWRK=BYS34A + BYS34B;

Description:
Indicates the average number of hours per weekday spent watching
TV/videos or playing video/computer games during the 01-02 school
year. Hours per weekday watching TV/videos and hours per weekday
playing video/computer games were collected separately as part of the
base year questionnaire.
Note: The two input variables for this composite were top-coded at "6
or more hours". BYTVVIGM is set to "8 or more hours" for any case
where one of these input variables is top-coded at "6 or more hours"
if the other input variable is at least 2 hours. If, however, one
input indicates "6 or more hours" and the other input indicates 0 or 1
hours, BYTVVIGM is set to 99 ("top-coded input; unable to calculate").
SAS code:
If BYS48A in (-4,-8) then BYTVVIGM=BYS48A;
  else if (BYS48A<0 or BYS49A<0) then BYTVVIGM=-9;
